        <h1>💜 A Little Confession</h1>

        <p>
            Since you said you might cut everyone off after school…
        </p>

        <p>
            And I’m not part of your plans after school,
            I’ve decided to start doing things for us that will make us happy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Genuinely, I haven’t been happy for a while,
            but I don’t want to keep anything from you anymore.
            I want to be honest about how I feel…
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            Honestly, I don’t ever want to lose you, baby.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because what we have means too much to me 💜
        </p>
